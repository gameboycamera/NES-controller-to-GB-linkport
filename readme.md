##NES controller to Game Boy linkport PCB

#About
A remote controller that connects to the Game Boy Link Port. 

The PCB is shaped nearly 1:1 the size of an NES controller PCB, allowing it to fit inside an OEM shell. 

This board is meant interface with [HerrZatacke](https://github.com/HerrZatacke)'s custom Game Boy Camera ROM [2bit PXLR Studio](https://github.com/HerrZatacke/2bit-pxlr-studio) and [Toxa](https://github.com/untoxa)'s Game Boy Camera ROM [Photo!](https://github.com/untoxa/gb-photo). That said, another ROM's code could be adapted to work with this, if they wish.
